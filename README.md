### FamilyDictionary

This was an exercise for NSS C#/.Net.

## Instructions

1. Define a Dictionary that contains information about several members of your family. Use the following example as a template.

        Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, string>> myFamily = new Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, string>>();
        myFamily.Add("sister", new Dictionary<string, string>(){ {"name", "Krista"}, {"age", "42"}});

2. Next, iterate over each item in `myFamily` and produce the following output.

        Krista is my sister and is 42 years old
